Cocktails 

The brief was to "Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes"
My girlfriend love drinking cocktails together so that is where the idea for making a cocktail recipe book. 

Many people like cocktails but hear the name and have no idea what's in them. Now they can stored there cocktails 
and it yummy yum or what ever pleases them. 

UX

As the user loads up the page they will see a call to action that will lead them add a recipe page. 
Once they have click add cocktail they brought back to the home page were they can see there new cocktail recipe.
This list does a nice popout from the main page, it will show the name, author and details. 
If the user wishes to edit there recipe they can with a button that will take them to an editing page.
If they wish to delete the recipe they can also do that with a simple click of button.

After the user has added a few recipes they can get a full run down in a form of a pie chart of what the most used
spirts are. 

The cocktail recipes that have been entered and the diffculty level of the coctail came from the below link.

Features 
The features on this page are as follows. 
    creating a recipe
        A diffculty level
        Allergic to stawberries
        Multple selection of spirts that can be added rather than one. 
    seeing a detailed list of recipes
    The ability to edit and delete recipes
    A pie chart that shows the most used spirts in the lists that have been created. 

Features that could be implemented in the future.
    I would have liked to add some recipes that the user could use as a starting point and 
    remove anything they wished.



Following the mini projects used of materializecss I also used that liberay and added some extra features like
muiltple select function for picking different spirt types. 

Creation of the data base with mlab that was linked to cloud9.

For the chart part of the project I wanted to show what the most used spirts were when the user put in there recipes.
I put in a form of a pie chart so that it would be easy to see and reflect the theme of recipes.
